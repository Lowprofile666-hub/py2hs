# gomoku-python
An interactive [Gomoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gomoku) game written in Python.


This python version of Gomoku is generated by passing the gomoku-haskell source code to [GPT-4](https://openai.com/product/gpt-4) and asking it to translate the code to python. There were some manually fixes required to get the code to run, but it was a fun experiment.


## Usage
```
python3 gomoku.py
```
